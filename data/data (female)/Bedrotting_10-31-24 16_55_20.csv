And I know my room is disgusting and unhygienic but this is the reality of what depression can do to some people. i’m not lazy and the mess does bother me greatly, but I physically am not able to do anything about it.  This is hard for me to post because i’m so embarrassed about the state of my room and don’t want anyone to see it and judge me. Most of my closest friends have never even seen my room, because this is the state it’s in 98% of the time. But i want to be open and vulnerable on here to show people it’s nothing to be ashamed about. Depression is an extremely painful sickness and even surviving through the day is a great battle, so if your room also looks like this or if you’re beating yourself up for having a messy room, know that i’m proud of you and you are doing the very best you can !  I’m also seeing allot of people refer to there room as a ‘depression’ room as a way of using the word depression as an adjective. Depression is not an adjective. It’s an incredible difficult illness that many people d!€ from. It should not be used as a replacement for the word ‘messy’. If a few of your clothes are on your chair instead of in your closet or if you forgot to put away a cup; that’s something very different from a ‘depression room’. People who suffer from depression find even getting up to use the toilet too much sometimes; our room reflects how our depression manifests itself (and it’s not pretty)  I for example how molding food in my room, countless empty bottles and plates, used bandages that have never been thrown away and even mice and other insects. I cannot see my floor. I’m constantly breaking my neck trying to get to my bed or out of my room. I’ve broken countless things by accidently having stepped on them. I have no idea where most of my clothes are or if any of it is even clean. I’ve lost many important things because of the state of my room. I’m constantly late (which i am known for among my friends) but what they don’t know is it’s because i can’t find anything, which in turn stresses me out till the point of a panic attack, but i’m always too embarrassed to tell them that.  One thing that also upsets me is how much ‘bed rotting’ has become a trend. Taking a nap or laying in a little longer, is not ‘rotting’, that’s just resting. There have been a few times in my life where is spent weeks in my bed, and the only time I ever got up was to go to the toilet (and usually only after many hours of trying to ignore the fact that i have to pee because I didn’t want get up). One of the worst depressions in my life I spent 3 whole months in bed. And the entire time i did this, my bed clothes where not changed once. My pillow soaked up all the dirt of my unwashed hair and in turn made my skin horrible. In those 3 months i also gained an immense amount of weight because i was not moving. Other times I didn’t eat at all because I was too sucked into my ‘bed rotting’ i couldn’t even be bothered to make food.  None of this should be a ‘trend’, it’s not in anyway quirky or funny. It’s life altering and so incredibly difficult to go through and live with.  If you are also going through this right now, I want you to know i hear you and see you and to never be ashamed of the things you’ve done because of your depression, that is how you survived and i’m proud of you, and hope things start getting better for you soon <3   #mentalhealthmatters #venttok #depression #depressionroom #bedrotting #depressiveepisode #bedrottingcore #depressionroomcheck #depressionawareness  created by 😀 with ☆ kerika ☆’s Vampire empire",1.1M,5-2

There’s two reasons why is this popular.  1️⃣ self care. It can be very recharging to rest and recoup.  2️⃣ shut down. You get trapped in your bed, numb to everything bc you’re stuck in freeze mode.  🧠This is so common for intellectualizers because they know exactly WHY they are numb. They know what emotions are overwhelming & the root cause. But still can’t get out of shutdown. *keep reading for more on this* ✅✅If you are shut down, this is how to escape 👇👇  🔖SAVE THIS FOR LATER 1- stay. Sounds counter productive but you want to stay to increase awareness of what this feels like. Can you feel any body part? What about your hands holding your phone? What thoughts do u have? 2- regulate. You need to help your nervous system get back online. Start by bending your knees and moving them from side to side. You can also move the head in this manner as well.  3- once you woken up the body, you might start to feel the emotions that got you suck there. Create safety & FEEL the emotions.  💜Not sure how to feel? Especially for intellectualizers, FEELING emotions can be tricky 🧠You KNOW everything about the emotion already but there’s still a disconnect between your mind, body, & soul. 🛌That’s why you continue to get stuck in shutdown.
