I wanted to create my own list of several other legends in this space. . (1) Back to Back SWE: . Clement has been a mentor in my programming journey. Whether it was learning about the intricacies of Big O notation, sorting algorithms, binary trees, etc., I owe much of my understanding to him. His in-depth examples and crystal-clear explanations made even the most complex concepts accessible. . (2) Programming With Mosh: . Mosh is an icon in the programming world, and his ‘1 Hour’ tutorial series has provided me lots of value over the years. His tutorials are very insightful, helping programmers hit the ground running. I remember during my capstone project my team and I watched his beginner React Native tutorial, which got the ball rolling for us. . (3) Caleb Curry: . Caleb Curry is a master at simplifying complex concepts. He really improved my SQL skills before starting an internship in college. His tutorials provided me with the confidence I needed to tackle the internship head-on. Caleb’s ability to break down intricate topics in an easy-to-understand manner is truly powerful. . (4) Hitesh Choudhary: . Hitesh has an extensive library of videos that have been a lifesaver for me, particularly his HTML and CSS guides. He consistently delivers valuable content and has been a reliable source of knowledge throughout my career. . In conclusion, these creators have not only been instrumental in my programming education but have also played a significant role in helping me earn my CS degree and become a Software Engineer. Remember, there are countless resources out there to support you on your coding journey.
